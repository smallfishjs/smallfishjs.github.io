# Introduction

Smallfish is different from the previous React framework. It is developed from the internal application framework of the Ant Financial System, and is dedicated to solving the front-end development problems of the backend-office system. Smallfish provides a complete set of front-end development solutions for mid-range systems, strong constraints, strong specifications, and out-of-the-box, is the vision of smallfish.

## Why should I have a smallfish?

With the development trend of the small front-end business model, in order to meet the growing business needs, higher requirements are placed on the management and monitoring of all aspects of business products, thus improving the automation of internal systems has become an urgent issue for major companies. Things.

With this trend, the internal management system and monitoring system emerge in an endless stream. Within the Ant Financial Service, the whole family bucket solution that relies on the open source community from the beginning, such as: react + redux + webpack, is gradually derived from the development requirements of the business system. [dora](https://github.com/dora-js), [roadhog](https://github.com/sorrycc/roadhog) + [dva](https://dvajs.com/), [umi ](https://umijs.org/), bigfish and other frameworks or programs, the purpose is to simplify and improve front-end development.

Smallfish is a standardized front-end mid-plane solution derived from the shoulders of the two giants umi and bigfish. It has abandoned the flexibility, multi-plug-in and multi-configuration direction. We have experience based on a large number of internal systems. Provides a standard set of intermediate system production line processes.

## What can smallfish bring

Smallfish regulates and constrains every aspect of the front-end development process.

Smallfish is secondarily packaged and developed based on the powerful plug-in system of [umi](https://umijs.org/), which realizes all configuration switching and relies on the power of the community to standardize various scenarios. Package.

Therefore, using smallfish can complete the development of a complete front-end mid-station system.

## Relationship with other frameworks

### bigfish

Bigfish is an enterprise-level front-end development framework within Ant Financial, and smallfish has evolved from bigfish and is a set of solutions for external ecosystem developers. It can be understood as an external version of bigfish.

### umi

The framework part of smallfish is based on umi, but it is not as flexible as umi. umi is more like a front-end platform, which can grow a variety of customized solutions, and smallfish is focused on the enterprise-level mid-system front end. Developed solutions.

So you will find that smallfish is not a pure React framework. It is a system that guides the development of enterprise-level mid-level front-end, including:

- umi-based enterprise-level front-end development framework
- Supported scenario front-end solution documentation, guidelines
- Companion automation tools
