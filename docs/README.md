### What is smallfish?

Smallfish is a React front-end solution focused on mid-backend systems. It solves the problem of developing complex mid-backend systems and makes the entire development process simple, standardized and unified.

It contains the following three parts:

- Simple, unified, and standardized front-end framework
- Rich front-end scenario solution documentation
- Companion automation tools

### Quick start

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/smallfishjs/smallfish-boilerplate-management-system.git my-app

$ cd my-app

$ npm install // or yarn

$ npm start // or yarn start
```

> yarn(https://yarnpkg.com/) is a faster and more convenient package manager than npm
